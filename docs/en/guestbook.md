# Mini GuestBook

Maybe you've learned [Hello, Uliweb](hello_uliweb.html) this tutorial, and have some
sense to Uliweb, so, let's step into database world together, and see how to
use database simply.


## Prepare

There is already the whole GuestBook source code in uliweb-tests project. So you
can checkout from it:


```
svn checkout http://uliweb-tests.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/guestbook guestbook
cd guestbook
uliweb runserver
```

Enter [http://localhost:8000/guestbook](http://localhost:8000/guestbook) in the browser, then you'll find it.
By default, it'll use sqlite3, so if you are using Python 2.5, you'll not need
to install sqlite Python binding module. Or you need to install pysqlite2 package
yourself. For now, Uliweb uses [SqlAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org) for
underlying database driven module, it already supports many database, such as:
mysql, sqlite, postgresql, etc. Before you want to use
other databases, you should also install their database module first.

Ok, let's begin to write code.


## Create Project

I suggest that you begin your work in a new directory, for example:


```
uliweb makeproject guestbook
```

So it'll export all necessary Uliweb source code to outputdir directory. Then
goto this directory, ready to begin.


## Create App

Goto the project directory built in previous step, and use `makeapp` to create a
new app.


```
cd samples
uliweb makeapp GuestBook
```

This will automatially create a `GuestBook` app for you in `apps`
directory of your project.


## Configure Database

In this tutorial we'll use Uliweb orm to access database. And there is also
a builtin orm app, so that you can use it directly. Just editing `guestbook/apps/settings.ini`,
then change the `INSTALLED_APPS` to:


```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'uliweb.contrib.orm',
    'GuestBook',
    ]
```

Then add following content:


```
[ORM]
CONNECTION = 'sqlite:///guestbook.db'
```

So the `settings.ini` will look like:


```
[GLOBAL]
DEBUG = False
DEBUG_CONSOLE = False

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'uliweb.contrib.orm',
    'GuestBook',
    ]

[ORM]
CONNECTION = 'sqlite:///guestbook.db'
```

ORM.CONNECTION is the connection string of orm, it's the same as SQLAlchemy package,
the generic format will look like:


```
provider://username:password@localhost:port/dbname?argu1=value1&argu2=value2
```

For Sqlite, the conntection is somewhat different:


```
sqlite_db = create_engine('sqlite:////absolute/path/to/database.txt')
sqlite_db = create_engine('sqlite:///d:/absolute/path/to/database.txt')
sqlite_db = create_engine('sqlite:///relative/path/to/database.txt')
sqlite_db = create_engine('sqlite://')  # in-memory database
sqlite_db = create_engine('sqlite://:memory:')  # the same
```

Here we use relative path format, so the `guestbook.db` will be created at guestbook
folder.


## Template Environment Extension

Because we want to enable user input plain text and output them as HTML code,
so we'll use uliweb.utils.text2html function to convert text to HTML code, and
we can indeed import this function in template file, but we can also bind
`prepare_view_env` dispatch point, and inject a `text2html` function object to
template environment, so that you can use `text2html` directly in template.
Open `GuestBook/__init__.py` and adding below codes:


```
from uliweb.core.dispatch import bind

@bind('prepare_view_env')
def prepare_view_env(sender, env, request):
    from uliweb.utils.textconvert import text2html
    env['text2html'] = text2html
```

This is a dispatch receiver function usage example, and there are some others plugin hook you can
use. And this hook point is global availabe, so other apps can also use it.

And we can also import text2html in template, so above just an example.

## Prepare Model

Creating a `models.py` file in GuestBook directory, and add below code:


```
from uliweb.orm import *

class Note(Model):
    username = Field(CHAR)
    message = Field(TEXT)
    homepage = Field(str, max_length=128)
    email = Field(str, max_length=128)
    datetime = Field(datetime.datetime, auto_now_add=True)
```

It's easy now, right?

First, you should import something from `uliweb.orm`, and here import everything.

Then, you need to import datetime module. Why you need it? Because Uliorm
supports two ways to define field:


* One way is using internal Python data type, e.g. int, float, unicode,
    datetime.datetime, datetime.date, datetime.time, decimal.Decimal, str, bool, etc.
    And I also extend some other types, such as: BLOB, CHAR, TEXT, DECIMAL.
    So you can use Python data type directly.
* The other way is using any Property class just like GAE, e.g. StringProperty, UnicodeProperty,
    IntegerProperty, BlobProperty, BooleanProperty, DateProperty, DateTimeProperty,
    TimeProperty, DecimalProperty, FloatProperty, TextProperty.

You should define your own model, and it should be inherited from `Model` class.
Then you can define fields which you want to use. There is a handy function named
`Field()`, you can pass it a Python data type, it'll automatically find a suit
Property class for you.


```
class Note(Model):
    username = StringProperty()
    message = TextProperty()
    homepage = StringProperty()
    email = StringProperty()
    datetime = DateTimeProperty()
```

Each field may also has other arguments, for example:


* default
* max_length
* verbose_name

etc.

Fields like CharProperty and StringProperty should have max_length attribute, and
if you don't give it, the default value will be 30.


{% alert class=info %}
When you define Model class, Uliorm will automatically add a `id` field for
you, it'll be a primary key.
{% endalert %}

## Configure Model and Create Table

In Uliweb, you should configure all models in settings.ini, just like this:

```
[MODELS]
note = 'GuestBook.models.Note'
```

So you can save above configuration in GuestBook app `settings.ini` or `apps/settings.ini`,
but in app's settings.ini is recommended, because it's more suitable for reuse of apps.

Then when can run:

```
uliweb syncdb
```

in project directly. So that uliweb will automatically create tables for you.

## Static Files Serving

We'll need to display static files later, now we can just add `uliweb.contrib.staticfiles`
to `INSTALLE_APPS` of `settings.ini`. Using this app, all static directories of
available apps will be processed as static folder, and the URL link will start
begin with `/static/`. Now the `settings.ini` will look like:


```
[GLOBAL]
DEBUG = False
DEBUG_CONSOLE = False

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'uliweb.contrib.orm',
    'uliweb.contrib.staticfiles',
    'GuestBook',
    ]

[ORM]
CONNECTION = 'sqlite:///guestbook.db'
```

As soon as you've added `uliweb.contrib.staticfiles`, you can call `url_for_static()`
in views or template. This function will create url for files in static folder of
each App.


## Display Comments


### Change index() function in view

Open `views.py` in `GuestBook` directory, and change it to:


```
#coding=utf-8
from uliweb import expose, functions

@expose('/')
def index():
    Note = functions.get_model('note')
    notes = Note.all().order_by(Note.c.datetime.desc())
    return {'notes':notes}
```

In beginning, we import `expose` and `functions` function, then we can use
`functions.get_model()` to get real `note` Model class according the settings.ini.
And we can get all comments in `index()`
via `Note.all()` statement. In order to display the comments descend to datetime,
we add `order_by()` clause. This is SqlAlchemy query expression usage.

Here are some simple usages:


```
notes = Note.all()                          #Gain all records, with no condition
note = Note.get(3)                          #Gain records with id equals 3
note = Note.get(Note.c.username=='limodou') #Gain records with username equals 'limodou'
```

Then we'll return `{'notes':notes}`. Remember, when you return a dict variable,
Uliweb will automatically find a matched template to render the HTML page.


{% alert class=info %}
In Uliweb, every visit URL should be bound to a view function. Using `expose`
you should pass a URL to it, and it'll bind this URL to below function. And it'll
convert a view function object to a string format, just like:


```
apps.appname.viewmodule.functioname
```

And Uliweb also provides a reversed URL creating function - url_for, you can
use it to create a URL according view function string like above format. We
will see its usage in template later.
{% endalert %}


### Create Layout Template File

I don't want to repeat myself again, because I've already made a YAML layout template
file before, and it's in uliweb.contrib now, so you can also use this CSS framework
to get beautiful representation.

Create a `base.html` file in `GuestBook/templates` directory, the content should be:


```
{{extend "yaml_base_layout.html"}}
{{block nav}}{{end}}
{{block topnav}}{{end}}
{{block header}}<h1><a href="{{=url_for('GuestBook.views.index')}}">
Uliweb Guest Book</a></h1>{{end}}
```

So you can see, we extend `yaml_base_layout.html` template, and override some blocks
defined in parent template. Here we use `url_for` to get reversed URL according
the view function name.


### Create index.html Template File

Create a `index.html` file in `GuestBook/templates` directory, it'll be matched
to index() function. And add below content to it:

```
1     {{extend "base.html"}}
2     {{block content}}
3     <h2><a href="{{=url_for('GuestBook.views.new_comment')}}">New Comment</a></h2>
4     {{for n in notes:}}
5           <div class="info">
6           <h3><a href="{{= url_for('GuestBook.views.del_comment', id=n.id) }}">
7           <img src="{{= url_for_static('delete.gif') }}"/>
8           </a> {{=n.username}} at {{=n.datetime.strftime('%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S')}} say:</h3>
9           <p>{{<<text2html(n.message)}}</p>
10          </div>
11    {{pass}}
12    {{end}}
```

The first line means this template will inherit from `base.html`.

And `{{block content}}` means that we'll override the "content" block defined
in parent template. But you may ask, why I haven't seen the "content" block
definition in `base.html`. Because it's defined in `yaml_base_layout.html`.

Line 3 will display an URL for add new comment.

Line 4 tills line 11 are a loop. Remember Uliweb uses web2py template module, but makes some
improvements. The code between {{}} can be any Python code, so they should
follow the Python syntax. Thus, the `:` at the end of block statement can't be omitted.
You can also put html code in {{}}, but can't use them directly, you should
output them using `out.write(htmlcode)`. When the block is ended, don't forget
to add a `{{pass}}` statement. And you don't need to worry about the indent,
Uliweb will reindent for you, as long as you add the correct pass statement.

In loop, it'll process the notes object, and then display a delete link, and
then user info and user comments.

Have you seen `{{<<text2html(n.message)}}`? It uses `text2html` function which we
defined in __init__.py to convert plain text to html code.

Ok, after above working, displaying comments is finished. But for now, you can't
add comment yet, so let's see how to adding comment.


## Add comment


### Add new_comment() function to view

In the index.html, we've already add some code to create `New Comment` URL:


```
<a href="{{=url_for('GuestBook.views.new_comment')}}">New Comment</a>
```

You can see, I use `url_for` to create reversed URL. `url_for` we've covered before,
the only thing you need notice here is the function named `new_comment`, so we
need to create such function in views.py.

Open the views.py file, and add below code:


```
1     @expose('/new')
2     def new_comment():
3         from forms import NoteForm
4         import datetime
5
6         form = NoteForm()
7         if request.method == 'GET':
8             return {'form':form, 'message':''}
9         elif request.method == 'POST':
10            flag = form.validate(request.params)
11            if flag:
12                Note = functions.get_model('note')
13                n = Note(**form.data)
14                n.save()
15                return redirect(url_for(index))
16            else:
17                message = "There is something wrong! Please fix them."
18                return {'form':form, 'message':message}
```

The URL will be `/new` for `new_comment()` function.

Line 3 will import NoteForm, what's it? It's a form class, we can use it to
validate data, and even output HTML form code. I'll introduce it later.

Line 6 will create an instance from NoteForm.

According to `request.method` is `GET` or `POST`, we can decide to execute different
process. For `GET` method, we'll display an empty Form, for `POST` method, it means
user has submitted data, and need to be processed. And for `GET`, it also means
read operation, for `POST`, it means write operation.

Line 8, we'll pass a dict to template, and it'll show and empty Form page.

If the `request.method` is `POST`, we'll invoke `form.validate(request.params)`
to validate submitted data by user. And if you want only validate request.POST,
you can only pass request.POST to validate() function. It'll return the validation
result, if `True`, it means the validation is successful. And the submitted data will
be parsed to Python data type, and be bound to relative Form fields.

If you want to access certain field, you can use `form.field.data` to get the parsed
value. And if you want to get all data, you can use `form.data`. And if the validation
is failed, the error message will also be bound to each field.

Then we can invoke `n = Note(**data)` to create a new
Note record, after that the new Note object is not be insert into database
yet, so you need to invoke `n.save()` or `n.put()` to commit it.

Then, we will invoke `return redirect` to jump another page, it's the homepage of
GuestBook. Here we use `url_for` again to create reversed URL. And this time we use
`index()` function object but not function string.

If the validation is failed, the flag variable should be `False`. We'll assign
an error message to message variable, then show the form again.


### Define Form

In order to interact with server, uesr can through browser to input data,
so you should provide Form HTML element to receive the input data. For an experienced
web developer, he can write HTML code manually, but it's difficult for newbies.
And you should also think about how to deal with error, data format conversion, etc.
So many frameworks provide such Form helper tool, Uliweb also provides such thing.
The Form module will be used for this.

Creating a `forms.py` file in `GuestBook` directory, then add below code:


```
from uliweb.form import *

class NoteForm(Form):
    message = TextField(label='Message:', required=True)
    username = StringField(label='Username:', required=True)
    homepage = StringField(label='Homepage:')
    email = StringField(label='Email:')
```

First, importing `Form` module. For now, Uliweb supports several form layout,
one is table layout which uses `table` tag, other is css layout which uses
`div` tag. And another will use `div` tag, but suit for YAML CSS framework.
The default layout is just yaml form layout.

Then, we'll create NoteForm class, here I define 4 fields, each field maps a
type. For example, TextField means multilines text input, StringField means
single line text input, and you can also use: HiddenField, SelectField,
FileField, IntField, PasswordField, RadioSelectField, etc.

Maybe you've seen that, some of these fields have type, e.g. IntField, so it'll
be automatically convert submitted data to Python data type, and convert back
when creating HTML code.

Each field may has some arguments, for example:


* label used to display a label tag
* required if a field can't be empty
* default default value
* validators used to validate the data

It likes the definition of Model, but they are different.


### Create new_comment.html Template File

Creating a `new_comment.html` file in `GuestBook/templates` directory, then add beclow code:


```
{{extend "base.html"}}
{{block content}}
{{if message:}}
    <p class="warning">{{=message}}</p>
{{pass}}
<h1>New Comment</h1>
<div class="form">
{{<<form}}
</div>
{{end}}
```

First line is `{{extend "base.html"}}`, it means that you'll extend from `base.html`
template file.

Next it'll override content block.

Next is a if statement, it'll test if the message is not empty, if not, then
display it. Notice the `:` at the end of the line. And here we use `class="warning"`,
this CSS class also comes from YAML.

Then display form element, here I used `{{<<form}}`. Because we don't want the
form code be escaped, so we need to use `{{<<}}` tag.

Now, you can try current work in the browser.


## Delete Comment

In `index.html`, we've defined a link which will be used to delete comment, the format
is:


```
<h3><a href="{{= url_for('GuestBook.views.del_comment', id=n.id) }}">
```

So let's implement it.

Open `GuestBook/views.py` file, and append below code:


```
@expose('/delete/<id>')
def del_comment(id):
    Note = functions.get_model('note')
    n = Note.get(int(id))
    if n:
        n.delete()
        return redirect(url_for(index))
    else:
        error("No such record [%s] existed" % id)
```

Delete is simple, first get the object according the `id` parameter passwd from
view function. `Note.get(int(id))` will get the object, then if the object
existed, then call `n.delete()` to delete the record. Or display an error page.


### URL Arguments Definition

Notice, here, expose() uses an argument, i.e. `<id>`. Once there are something
like `<type:para>` in the URL, that's means you defined an argument. And `type`
can be optional. Uliweb provides many builtin types, such as: int, float, path,
any, string, uniocde. And you can find more details in [URL Mapping](url_mapping.html)
document. If you just define `<name>` format, it just means matching something
between `//`. Once you defined some arguments in the URL, you must define the
same arguments in the view function, so `del_comment()` function should be written
in `del_command(id)`. There the `id` arugment is the same as the one in URL.

Ok, now you can try if the delete function can be used.


### Error Page

When there are something wrong, you may need to show an error page to user, so
you can use `error()` function to return an error page. `return` is no need in front
of it, just give it an error message, that's enough.

How to create error template file? Just create a file named `error.html` in
your app templates directory, and add something like:


```
{{extend "base.html"}}
{{block title}}Error{{end}}
{{block header}}<h1>Error!</h1>{{end}}
{{block content}}
<p>{{=message}}</p>
{{end}}
```

It's simple right, we extend from `base.html`, then override title block, header
block and content block. And this page need a `message` variable.


## Run

In previous developing procedure, you can also start a developing server to test
your project. The command of starting a developing server is:


```
uliweb runserver
```

When it starting, you can input `http://localhost:8000/` to test this
GuestBook demo.


## Screen Casts

Let's see some screen casts, this will make more sense.

Homepage:


![image](_static/image01.jpg)

New Comment Page:


![image](_static/image02.jpg)

Error Comment Page:


![image](_static/image03.jpg)


## Conclusion

Wow, we've learnt so many things for now:


1. ORM usage, including: ORM initilization, Model definition, simple add, delete, query.
1. Form usage, including: Form definition, Form layout, HTML creation, data validation, error process.
1. Template usage, including: {{extend}} and {{block}} usage, add custom variables to template.
    environment, define variables in child template, write Python code in template.
1. View usage, including: redirect usage, error usage, static files serving.
1. URL mapping usage, including: expose usage, arguments definition.
1. uliweb command line tool usage, including: makeproject, makeapp, runserver usage.
1. Architecture knowledge, including: the organization of Uliweb, settings process.
    flow mechanism, the mapping between view function and template file.

Yes, there are too much things. However these are not the whole stuff of Uliewb
yet. Along with the application becomes more complex, the functionalities of
frameworks will be more and more. But I think a good framework should enable
experienced developers build an environment which should be easy to use and easy
to manage, then the others of this team could work under this environment, and
the duty of those expericenced developers should to change to make this
environment better and powerful. I hope Uliweb can step foward to this goal.
