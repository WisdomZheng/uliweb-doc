# uliweb Command Guide

`uliweb` is a command line tool provided by Uliweb, you can use it to do
many works. When you install Uliweb from:


```
python setup.py develop
```

or:


```
python setup.py install
```

or:


```
easy_install uliweb
```

it'll create a script named `uliweb` in Python/Scripts folder. So if you
want to use it directly in command line, you should setup Python installation
path and Python/Scripts path to `PATH` environment variable. When you finish
it, then you can run `python` and `uliweb` directly in command line.

`uliweb` tool supports many action, I'll explain them one by one below.


## runserver

Startup development server.


```
Usage: uliweb runserver [options]

options:

-h hostname

    Development server host name, default is ``localhost``.

-p port

    Development server host port, defalt is ``8000``.

--no-reloader

    If automatically reload changed modules when you made some changes, default
    is ``True``.

--no-debugger

    If automatically show debug page when there is exception throwed, default
    is ``True``.
```

Example:


```
uliweb runserver
```


## runadmin

Start developing server with admin app.


```
Usage: uliweb runadmin
```

It's very like `runserver` command, but the difference is it'll automatically
add admin app to your project.


## makeproject

Create a new project directory according the given project name. If there is already
a same name project exists, it'll prompt that if you want to overwrite it, you can
choice 'y' or 'n'.


```
Usage: uliweb makeproject projectname
```

Example:


```
uliweb makeproject test
```


## makeapp

Create a new app directory structure according the given app name, it'll include
initial sub-directories and files. After you created project, you should change
current path to the project folder first. Say the project folder is `./test`,
after you created the project, there should be a `apps` sub-folder in `./test`, so
`./test/apps` is the exactly apps directory. And if you execute `makeapp` command,
it'll find the `apps` folder in current directory, and create app folder in `apps`
folder. If there is no `apps` foder in current directory, it'll create a `apps`
folder in current directory, then create app folder in `apps` folder.


```
Usage: uliweb makeapp appname
```

Example:


```
uliweb makeproject test
cd test
uliweb makeapp Hello
```

It'll create a Hello app in `./test/apps` directory of `test` project folder,
the app folder name is `Hello`.


## makepkg


```
Usage: uliweb makepkg pkgname
```

Creating a directory according Python package structure, that's including a
__init__.py in it.


## exportstatic

Export all files from availabe apps static directory to target directory.
You can set availabe apps name in apps/settings.py via INSTALLED_APPS option, for
example: INSTALLED_APPS=['Hello', 'Documents']. If you didn't set it, all folders
in apps will be treated as an available app. When exporting static files, if there
are some files with same name, it'll be checked if the content is the same by
default, and give you some messages in the console, and skip this file. But you
can disable this check of cause.


```
Usage: uliweb exportstatic [options] outputdir

options:

-v

    Output verbose information, default is not output.

-no-check

    If check the same named files content, default is enabled, if found,
    it'll output some message and skip the file.
```

Example:


```
uliweb exportstatic ../uliweb_test
#Export all available apps static to ../uliweb_test directory.
```


## i18n

I18n process tool, you can use it to extract translation catalog from
python source files and template files, the translation function is _().
You can process a single app or all apps by in separately or whole project.
It'll create .pot file. For app mode, the .pot file will be saved in
`yourproject/apps/appname/locale/lang/LC_MESSAGE/uliweb.pot`. For whole project mode, the
.pot file will be saved in `yourproject/local/lang/LC_MESSAGE/uliweb.pot`.
And lang should be different according the language which you want to deal with.
You can also use it to automatically merge .pot to existed .po file.


```
Usage: uliweb i18n [options]

options:

-a appname

    Process a single appname, can't be used with --all, -w together.

--all

    Process all available apps, can't be used with -a, -w together.

-w

    Process whole project, can't be used with -a, --all together.

-l locale

    If not provided, it'll be ``en``. If Provided, it'll be used as language
    name. I suggest that you should use ``en_US`` format(language_locale).

-m

    If automatically merge .pot with existed .po file, default is not automatically
    merge.
```

Example:


```
uliweb i18n -a appname -l zh #Single app process
uliweb i18n --all -l zh      #All of available apps process
uliweb i18n -w               #Whole apps process, and using default locale ``en``.
```


## extracturls

Extract URL definition from each view modules, so you should define URL via
expose() first. It'll output the urls to apps/urls.py file. And if there is
apps/urls.py, Uliweb will automatically import it then disable expose().


```
Usage: uliweb extracturls
```

If there is already a urls.py file in apps directory, it'll prompte you
to confirm you want to overwrite it.


## call


```
Usage: uliweb call name
```

Executing all <name>.py from every installed App.
