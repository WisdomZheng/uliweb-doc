# Hello, Uliweb

This tutorial will get you started with the Uliweb framework.
In the following simple demo, we're going to generate a plain page
which displays "Hello, Uliweb." step by step.


## 1\ \ \ Getting Started


The first thing would be to read this article [Installation](installation), --
    a correct installation of Uliweb is a prerequisite.



## 2\ \ \ Creating a new project

Uliweb provides a command line tool named `uliweb`, you can use
it to execute several commands.

At the command line,  change to or create a directory in which you want to create new
Uliweb project,  then execute:


```
uliweb makeproject project
```

If the command execution is successful, it'll output nothing and create a
directory named `hello_project`. A clean workspace is created with relevant files
for the project in this directory.

The project folder will be:


```
|-- app.yaml
|-- apps/
|   `-- settings.ini
|-- gae_handler.py
|-- runcgi.py
`-- wsgi_handler.wsgi
```


## 3\ \ \ Creating the 'Hello' app


```
cd project
uliweb makeapp Hello
```

Go into `project` directory, create a new app following the command as
shown. You can substitute the name of the app, `Hello` with another name of your choice.

After the command above is executed successfully,
you can find the following files in `apps/Hello` directory:


```
|-- __init__.py
|-- conf.py
|-- info.ini
|-- static/
|   `-- readme.txt
|-- templates/
|   `-- readme.txt
`-- views.py
```


## 4\ \ \ Starting the server

After the above steps, you can start up your web project as follows:


```
uliweb runserver
```

Following the instructions and information printout to the console, you can
open a browser and enter the url [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).  You would see a rendered
page with the message "Hello, Uliweb" . Congratulations!


## 5\ \ \ Modifying the "View"

When user requests an URL, Uliweb tries to map the URL to a view function. So in
the case of our example, the request for [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) would map to a function
thatmaps to the "/" location on our server. To see how this works, take a look in
the `Hello/view.py` file. All your view functions should be declared in this file.
Open it in your favourite editor, then you will see:


```
#coding=utf-8
from uliweb import expose

@expose('/')
def index():
    return '<h1>Hello, Uliweb</h1>'
```

The above code was generated automatically when you executing `makeapp`,
and we even don't need write any code, the  !

`@expose('/')` decorator is used for URL Mapping, which means map the url `'/'` to
the view function below. So when visiting [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), function `index()`
will be called. If a view function is not decorated by `expose`, it will not
be mapped to any url and is treated as a local function.

This function will return a line of HTML code that will be displayed directly in browser.


## 6\ \ \ Adding templates

If your view function returns a dict object, Uliweb will apply it to a template automatically.
It means that different return value will cause a different action.
The template is the same name as your view function with '.html' suffix.
For example, the template of `index()` is `index.html`.
Templates should be placed into the directory `templates` which will be automatically
created when creating a new app. Now let's add a new function to test template
process.


```
@expose('/template')
def template():
    return {}
```

Then create a new file `template.html` in `apps/Hello/templates` with contents
like below:


```
<h1>Hello, Uliweb</h1>
```

Visit [http://localhost:8000/template](http://localhost:8000/template) in the browser, you will see the same thing as the previous one.


## 7\ \ \ Using template variables

In above two examples, all data are outputed directly, we're going to use template
variables to change that. Add another view function with the following code:


```
@expose('/template1')
def template1():
    return {'content':'Uliweb'}
```

The function `template1()` returns a dict object with `content` which representing
the content to be displayed. If you feel uncomfortable with the `{}`, try
this alternative:


```
return dict(content='Uliweb')
```

or:


```
content = 'Uliweb'
return locals()
```

The first one uses `dict()` to construct a dict object while
the second one uses the builtin function `locals()` directly - as long as you
define the corresponding variables in current scope. Although `locals()` may
return some irrelevant variables, it is not harmful.

Then create `template1.html` in `apps/Hello/templates` with contents like below:


```
<h1>Hello, {{=content}}</h1>
```

`{{=content}}` represents outputing value of `content` to template. Here you can use a
variable or a function with return value between `{{=` and `}}`.


{% alert class=info %}
The development server provided by Uliweb has the ability to reload apps,
you don't need to restart the server too often when making changes -
refreshing you browser is enough in most situations. However, when
you are struck with templates cache or something goes wrong seriously,
you do need to restart it. Pressing Ctrl + C in command line can shutdown
the server, and then you can restart it.

{% endalert %}
